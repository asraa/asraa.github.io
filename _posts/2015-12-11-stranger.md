There's an art gallery on Newbury called [Know No Truth](http://knownotruth.com).

Landon Richmond, the artist, is fantastic -- at first glance, his art is a little creepy, a little dark. I've noticed the pieces usually have a specific theme/purpose (here's a [favorite](http://www.knownotruth.com/prints/the-reminder)).

They also have art gallery receptions occasionally! In this one (titled Stranger), they were showing a visiting artist's prints.

I actually got a print for free:

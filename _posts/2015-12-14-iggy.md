I sewed a stuffed animal.

What's next? E-textiles. I really want to get into this. I want to make beautiful art, smart art, and (maybe) mobile art.

Speaking of which, over IAP I'm planning on making a robot that _makes_ art. So maybe I won't need to to do the art this time. (If that goes well, there'll be more on that later!)

About 8 months ago, I promised a friend a birthday gift. A homemade birthday gift. 8 months late. (I didn't actually promise it being 8 months late, it just so turned out. But in the end, it happened!)

This friend has a [webcomic](http://archr.org). Go read it!

I sewed him the main character:

Ohhh, what really would have made this better (a project for later?) is to give  him a stuffed animal with a little LCD display text-bubble that randomly outputs (and generates?) a joke.

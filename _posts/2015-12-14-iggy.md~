On 12/13 I went to a Black Market.

Boston Hassle holds these every once in a while: local artists/craftsman/haircutters(!)/musicians sell their artwork at a venue that's clearly overcrowded and stuffed one too many local goths/hipsters/artists/hippies in a single spot.

The art was awesome! I like going -- it's fairly inspiring to me. Makes me feel in general pretty motivated to get do more art/make things.

I did consume one piece of artwork (by Sean Patrick Watroba), because it reminded me so much of a friend:
